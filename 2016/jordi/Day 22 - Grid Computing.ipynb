    "You can instruct a node to move (not copy) all of its data to an adjacent node (if the destination node has enough space to receive the data). The sending node is left empty after this operation.\n",
    "Nodes are named by their position: the node named node-x10-y10 is adjacent to nodes node-x9-y10, node-x11-y10, node-x10-y9, and node-x10-y11.\n",

    "Before you begin, you need to understand the arrangement of data on these nodes. Even though you can only move data between directly connected nodes, you're going to need to rearrange a lot of the data to get access to the data you need. Therefore, you need to work out how you might be able to shift data around.\n",

    "You finally have a chance to look at all of the produce moving around. Chocolate, cinnamon, mint, chili peppers, nutmeg, vanilla... the Elves must be growing these plants to make hot chocolate! As you realize this, you hear a conversation in the distance. When you go to investigate, you discover two Elves in what appears to be a makeshift underground kitchen/laboratory.\n",

    "To create new recipes, the two Elves combine their current recipes. This creates new recipes from the digits of the sum of the current recipes' scores. With the current recipes' scores of 3 and 7, their sum is 10, and so two new recipes would be created: the first with score 1 and the second with score 0. If the current recipes' scores were 2 and 3, the sum, 5, would only create one recipe (with a score of 5) with its single digit.\n",

To do this, the Elf steps forward through the scoreboard a number of recipes equal to 1 plus the score of their current recipe. So, after the first round, the first Elf moves forward 1 + 3 = 4 times, while the second Elf moves forward 1 + 7 = 8 times. If they run out of recipes, they loop back around to the beginning. After the first round, both Elves happen to loop around until they land on the same recipe that they had in the beginning; in general, they will move to different recipes.\n",

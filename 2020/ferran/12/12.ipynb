When the captain uses the [PA system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system) to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character *actions* paired with integer input *values*. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " - Action *`N`* means to move *north* by the given value.\r\n",

      " - Action *`S`* means to move *south* by the given value.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " - Action *`E`* means to move *east* by the given value.\r\n",

      " - Action *`W`* means to move *west* by the given value.\r\n",

      " - Action *`L`* means to turn *left* the given number of degrees.\r\n",

      " - Action *`R`* means to turn *right* the given number of degrees.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ship starts by facing *east*. Only the `L` and `R` actions change the direction the ship is facing. (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is `N10`, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were `F`.)\r\n",
